This is a simulator of a game of gomoku, or five-in-a-row (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku).

The computer plays as the black piece and goes first, while the user plays as the white piece.
The board is synthesized as a matrix of arbitrary size set by the player,
and the player makes a move by inputting a row and column index.

The program terminates when either side wins, or when there is a draw. The computer
makes moves depending on which move is most optimal, as decided from a score calculator.

"w" indicates a white piece, and "b" indicates a black piece.
